<h2> IP address converter </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>While studying for my CCNA exam, I decided to make a simple tool that converts decimal IP addresses to their binary values and the other way around. It only accepts valid IPs and, for ease of usage, it allows for the conversion results to be copied to clipboard.</p>

<h3> Technology used </h3>
	- <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/">Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (Winforms)</a>

<h3> Screenshots </h3>

<p> Coming soon </p>
